PuneScala is the community site of Scala practitioners from Pune. It is started by developers at [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com/) who are passionate Scala users for many years. This is the place where we will announce Scala community events, training programs, workshops. We will be happy to have other local companies help in hosting events or speaking on Scala topics. This site is [hosted on github](https://github.com/punescala/punescala.github.io), send us pull requests with your Scala related updates.

Please ask questions/join discussions at [punescala google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/punescala). Join [PuneScala Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/punescala) to be notified about Scala related event announcements.
