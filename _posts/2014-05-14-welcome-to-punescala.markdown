We are happy to launch a new community site dedicated for Scala events in Pune. If you would like to participate by announcing a community event, blog post etc let us know. We recently hosted [Pune Scala Symposium](http://info.thoughtworks.com/pune-scala-symposium-april-12-registration.html) where we announced about a free for all Scala training in June. Well, the dates are finalized now, read more about it here. If you want to know about us visit the [About page](/about).
