Principles of Programming in Scala
----------------------------------

##### **Introduction to Functional Programming**

* Strategy Pattern
* Generic Strategy
* Functions as values, and Higher order functions
* Lambdas
* Difference between Methods and Functions
* Recursive functions
* Currying and partial function application and positional notation
* Tail recursion
* val , var, lazy val, pass-by-value and pass-by-name

##### **Object Oriented Programming in Scala**

* Classes, Objects, and Traits
* Case classes as Functional Objects
* Immutable objects
* Accessors
* Class extension, overriding vals, dynamic dispatch
* Name based dependency resolution
* Object hierarchy
* Exceptions and null type, unit
* Infix notation
* Operators as methods
* Tuples

##### **Pattern matching**

* Sample code for various patterns
* Option / Some / None
* Extractors
* Expression problem
* Pattern forms
* contants
* variables
* constructors
* exceptions
* PartialFunction


##### **Collections and combinators based programming**

* No syntax
* Immutable vs mutable collections
* Seq, Set, Map, Iterators
* map, filter, folding, reduce
* take, drop etc,
* Working with list: :: operator :::
* recursion
* Function composition
* foreach
* groupBy,
* flatMap, collect,
* for comprehensions
* Options with for

##### **Implicits**

* implicit classes: extension methods
* implicit defs: not-recommended (dotted relationships, array and string interoperability)
* implicit parameters: type classes
* Using tappers for debugging
* generic function
* Monad
* Reverse Ordering

##### **Misc Topics**

* Streams
* Regular expression
* Memory implications of immutable data structures
* Module system using traits
* packages and visibility
* Java-Scala interoperability: collections
* auxiliary constructors

##### **Pain-points of Scala**

* Compile times
* Binary compatibility
* Sbt
* Mixed coding styles
* IDEs
