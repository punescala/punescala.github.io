Principles of programming in Scala
----------------------------------

ThoughtWorks, Pune is glad to announce a free for all course in Scala programming. It is a 4-day course with live coding and hands on exercises (no slides, yay!).

##### **Contents**
The course will use Scala as a medium to introduce principles of both OOP and Functional programming. It will show you that FP and OOP are ying-yang of each other and how Scala unites them tastefully. It will also teach how to apply this novel combination to solve real world problems. Here is the outline of the syllabus covered in this course. Almost all examples will make use of only the Scala standard library. The course will NOT cover tools, frameworks, concurrency, actors and such. Those topics will be covered in future courses (for which the current course is a prerequisite).

##### **Dates, Timings, Food**
The course dates are 20th to 23rd June 2014 (Fri to Tue). Yes, you will have to put in 2 working days and the entire weekend to complete the course. Course timings will be 9am to 5pm. Breakfast, lunch and beverages will be provided by ThoughtWorks.

##### **Batch size**
The classroom will be around 20 people with a mix of candidates who qualify and ThoughtWorks developers themselves who have not done Scala earlier. We promise that the course will be fun and very different than the other trainings that you may have done earlier.

##### **Selection**
You must be a hands on programmer to apply. It does not matter then if you are a university student, experienced polyglot programmer, non-comp-science professional who does programming on the side as long as you can take a simple coding test. The coding problem will be sent via emails to all those who register. You can use any language you like to solve the problem. By design, the difficulty level of the problem will be low. It will test your basic coding skills and commitment to finish a given task (hopefully, implying the commitment to finish the course). It is also our tool to filter candidates which may not be able to benefit from the training.

##### **Deadlines**
June 13th
There is no deadline for registration and code submission. But we can only accommodate a small number in a batch. So please hurry up and register now by filling up the form on this page. Those who qualify but can not make in the first batch will be eligible to attend a future batch (yes, we are planning to do it more than once).

##### **Why is ThoughtWorks doing it for free?**
This is the same course we otherwise offer as a commercial corporate training. So why are we doing it for free? Well, we have been active Scala users for a long time but we see that Scala awareness in the local community is not great. We recently organized the Pune Scala Symposium where ThoughtWorks was the only company representing Pune among the speakers. Main objective of this programme is to bridge that gap. That does not mean it is restricted to only Puneites. If you can manage your own travel and stay, you are most welcome to apply.
